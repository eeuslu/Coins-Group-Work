# COINs Group 3 - Analyzing Words and Facial Emotions of Job Seekers
We are working with the Department of Psychology at University of Applied Sciences Zurich (Prof Marc Schreiber), using machine learning to identify the correlations between self-written emotional assessments of job seekers while watching a series of images, and their outcome (chosen jobs).

## Setup

Download and install the provided environment.yml file in this repository for setting up the consistent conda environment with the same package versions for all developers. There are two possible ways:

1) Using comand prompt with this tutorial: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html
2) Using the GUI of Anaconda Navigator, see the menu entry "Environments" with the possibility for "import".

After successfull installation of the environment file, please open the install_example.ipynb and run the code. At the end, you should see the text "test successfull".
